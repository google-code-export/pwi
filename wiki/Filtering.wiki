When using the Albums nomally all albums are shown. Using the methods described
on this page it is possible to selecte a subset of the albums. This can for
example be used to show only the albums of a certain year.

The albums shown can be filtered using three methods: on album name, on date and
on keywords.

  * Album name: using the albums-setting it is possible to select a subset of
    albmums using the names as given by Picasa.
  * Date: using the albumStartDateTime and albumStartDateTime it is possible to
    select a certain period. See example 12 in the download for an example.
  * Keywords: the keywords given in this setting are matched against keywords
    given in the description of the album. If all keywords match the album is
    shown in the overview. The keywords should be specified in the album
    description using:

}}}
